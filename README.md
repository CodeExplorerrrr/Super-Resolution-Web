# SR-Inference-Web

# Project Overview
A browser-based super-resolution inference tool that enhances image quality using AI models. This project allows users to upscale images directly in the web browser without needing to rely on server-side processing.

# Features
- Real-time image super-resolution processing
- Support for multiple image formats (e.g., JPG, PNG)
- Runs entirely in the browser with no server-side dependencies
- Powered by [Model Name] for AI inference
